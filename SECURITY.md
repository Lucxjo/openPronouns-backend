## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

Currently, there are no supported versions since the project isn't ready for release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I require that all vulnerabilities are made through encrypted chat for safety reasons. My email address supports PGP encryption so feel free to [email me](mailto:me@ludoviko.ch) using [this key](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=me%40ludoviko.ch).
I, however, recommend that you contact me through [[matrix]](https://matrix.to/#/@ludoviko_:matrix.org) since I check it far more often. I also have Session messenger, my ID is: 05f7525a7ff9448f1e83dc32b2634e9fbaccaa2ce41eea324183401136adf4e755. If you have a suggestion for how the vulnerability can be fixed, please do include it in your report.

When a vulnerability report has been made, I will send a response with exact timelines for what you can expect and to say the vulnerability has been logged. Once the vulnerability has been patched and verified, a public notice will be made to explain the situation.
