The openPronouns backend code

## What is openPronouns?
openPronouns is a service based around you and your pronouns. I have only just gotten started with the project so there isn't much to really show for my work.

## Why not use {alternative}?
You should definitely use an alternative like [pronouns.page](https://pronouns.page) or [Pronouny](https://pronouny.xyz) until we get the API and a frontend running. These alternatives are great for displaying your pronouns in a web GUI. The hopes for this project go beyond this.  

Once a basic API is running, I want to make it easy to self-host all of the backend code and the documentation will recommend steps to allow for services to integrate with the API that will allow for federation with other instances of the API that people may be running.  

This means that I will also create a standard specification to cover the base requirements that will allow other implementations of the API to be created and federate as if it was a direct clone of this implementation.

## Why federate?
Federation reduces the amount of trust required in a single person/company hosting the backend and frontend since the end user would have the option to run their own instance and own their data.
